### Abstract  
The complexity and uncertainty in medical diagnosis necessitate the development of intelligent systems capable of handling imprecise, vague, and ambiguous data. This research focuses on the design and development of a <strong>Soft Computing-based Diagnostic Information System</strong> to enhance decision-making in medical science. Utilizing fuzzy logic, hesitant fuzzy sets, and computing with words, the study addresses challenges in diagnosing diabetes, assessing kidney function, and ranking qualitative medical conditions. A novel <strong>Hesitant Fuzzy Envelope-based Expert System</strong> is introduced to model human decision-making under uncertainty. Additionally, a <strong>QUALIFLEX-based ranking approach</strong> is implemented to prioritize medical conditions efficiently. The research further explores a <strong>Diet Recommendation System</strong> incorporating soft computing techniques to provide personalized dietary suggestions. The findings contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostic systems, improving accuracy and decision support in healthcare.
